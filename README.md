This is my first Exploratory Data Analysis.
I literally have no idea what I'm doing except visualizing the data and looking for patterns and trying to answer questions.

Dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meeratif/pakistan-covid-dataset

**TO VIEW AND EDIT THE NOTEBOOK**
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed or simply install Anaconda.
2. Download the notebook.
3. Use VS Code or use Jupyter notebooks (which comes with Anaconda) to open and run and edit.

I'll prolly look back at this and smile one day.
